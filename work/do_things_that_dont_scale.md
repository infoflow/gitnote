One of the most common types of advice we give at Y Combinator
is to do things that don't scale. A lot of would-be founder 
belive that startups either take off or dont. You build something, make it available, and if you've made a better mousetrap,
people beat a path to your door as promised. Or they don't, in 
which case the market must not exist.

Actually startups take off becuse the founders make them take off. There may be a handful that just grew by themselves, but
usually it takes some sort of push to get them going. A good
metaphor would be the cranks that car engines had before they got electric starters. Once the engine was going, it would keep going, but there was a seperate and laborious process to get it going.
