## with clause
```sql

wiht q1 as (select key from src where key = '5')
select *
from q;

--- from style
with q1 as (select * from src where key = '5')
from q1
select *;

--- chaining CTEs
with q1 as (select * from src where key='5'),
     q2 as (select * from src where key='4')
select * from (select key from q1) a;

--- union example
with q1 as (select * from src where key='5'),
    q2 as (select * from src where key='4')
select * from q1 union all select * from q2;

--- insert example

create table s1 like src;
with q1 as (select * from src where key='5')
from q1
insert overwrite table s1
select *;

--- view example
create view v1 as 
with q1 as (select key from src where key='5')
select * from q1;
select * from v1;


--- view example, name collision
create view v1 as 
with q1 as (select key from src where key='5')
select * from q1;
with q1 as (select key from src where key='4')
select * from v1;
