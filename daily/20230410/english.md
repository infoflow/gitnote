In daily life, we often meet two types of people: the first type of people, who was adopt an open and positive
attitude in the fact of new challenge, becuase of daring to try, slowly accumulating resources and contacts, 
the road and life will become wider and wider.
The second type of people, even if everything is cautious and dare not make new attempts, can always hear that
they encounter various pits, the more torn, the more lost, walking on the ice every day, but getting nothing.
The second type of people, such as always playing the safety card in their comfort zone, dare not try break
throught the creation of new styles, so it seem that the harder they work, but the effect is not very good, 
and the whole person is becoming more and more anxious and impetuous.
But sometimes it's not that we don't work hard enough, but we are limited by our own pattern. Only focusing onthe present, without a longer-term perspective to gain insight into life, the road of life will only get narrower and narrower.
In the process of human growth, it is actually the same. When your vision, thinking, experience, information,
connections, etc. are all far from others. facing the same things, the same problems, the way you deal with 
them and the final result will be different.
When you  go from a small pattern to large pattern, those problems that seemed completely imposible to get ridof back will solved.
For example, family problems, inferiority complex problems, emotional problems, income problems, carrer development problems, etc.
When you open up your own world and improve your thinking horizons, compared with you in the past, it is also a kind of "dimensionality reduction blow", which is the "ultimate password" that a person become more and more
powerful.
In addition to reading ten thousand books, the first two levels of realm to impove the pattern must travel tenthousand miles.
Inspiration from books is always indirect. Whether it is experience or thought, it often takes a process to go from learning to mastering guiding practice. The best way to speed up this process is to experience it. 
A lot of growth in life is broght about by experience. Some people have been to many places since they were young, so they have a broad vision; some people have experienced the ups and downs of life, so they have a strong psychological endurance. 
If a person wants to expand the pattern, he must first clear his inner pursuit of stability, and be able to dare to step out of his comfort zone, see the customs and customs that he was never seen, and experience the life he has never experienced.
When you are in the current predicament, because you belive that you will life and ideal life, you will have the courage to stuggle. Using this pattern to integrate all your goals, means, thinking, etc. the process of moving forwad in life is the process of continously impoving yourself.
